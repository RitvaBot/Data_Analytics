# Data_Analytics
Python 0 to 1 class on data analysis 

I have tried out several simple data visualization methods in Jupyter Notebook. 
The purpose is to try different styles and data analytics. The data is in .csv file format, drawn from Nasdaq. 
I left one data set (Google stock prices) here as an example of the data we have used.

Please take a look and enjoy.
